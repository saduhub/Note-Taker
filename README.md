# Note Taker App

## Description

The motivation behind this project was to solidify my knowledge of express. I was to build the backend of a note-taking app using my knowledge of Javascript, Express, fs, and Node. Additionaly, this challenge introduced me to the concepts of route handlers, requests, responses, and how to connect the front end with the back-end. Understanding how to serve static files, promises, middleware, and localhost was also crucial for completing this project. Note: Introducing test suites using Jest is a future focus of this project.
