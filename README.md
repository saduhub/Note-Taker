## Description

The motivation behind this project was to solidify my knowledge of express. I was to build the backend of a note-taking app using my knowledge of Javascript, Express, fs, and Node. Additionaly, this challenge introduced me to the concepts of route handlers, requests, responses, and how to connect a front end created by another developer with a back-end that I developed myself. Understanding how to serve static files, promises, middleware, and localhost were also crucial for completing this project.

Throughout the development of this project, I gained valuable insights into the following areas:
  
- **Express.js**: My experience with Express.js has deepened my understanding of web server frameworks. This framework is a significant improvement over handling complex routing purely with JavaScript. It streamlined the process of creating server routes, managing incoming HTTP requests, and developing a RESTful API. Moreover, I gained valuable insights into request processing and how middleware functions play a role in processing requests.
  
- **Node.js and Server-Side JavaScript**: Using Node.js has allowed me to create a server-side run environment for JavaScript. Thus, Node.js allows me to use JavaScript not just for front-end but also for back-end development. Also, I have gained a deeper understanding of the non-blocking I/O model that Node.js employs. This knowledge is useful for creating web applications that can handle several operations at the same time.
  
- **Node Package Manager (NPM) and Dependency Management**: I expanded my knowledge of NPM's intricacies and my proficiency in managing project dependencies. This ensures that my project is built on a solid foundation and remains up-to-date with the latest features and security patches.
